### Lithuanian Battleship Rules

In the Lithuanian version of Battleship, the game is played on a 10x10 grid with the following ship configuration:

#### Ship Fleet
- **1 ship of 4 cells** (Battleship / Šarvuotis)
- **2 ships of 3 cells** (Cruiser / Kreiseris)
- **3 ships of 2 cells** (Destroyer / Eskadros minininkas)
- **4 ships of 1 cell** (Submarine / Povandeninis laivas)

#### Placement Rules
1. **Shapes**: Ships do not have to be straight lines. They can be of any shape (L-shape, T-shape, Z-shape, etc.) as long as all cells of the ship are connected horizontally or vertically (diagonal connection only is not allowed within a single ship).
2. **Contact**: Ships **cannot touch** each other at all. This includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal contact. There must be at least one empty cell between any two ships.
3. **Grid**: The game is played on a 10x10 grid.

#### Winning
The game ends when one player sinks all of the opponent's ships (total of 20 cells).
